## Instructions after cloning template

This boilerplate relies on poetry to help manage dependencies.
Please see https://python-poetry.org/docs/ for installation instructions.
Once installed, poetry install will configure the dependencies.

Once dependencies are resolved, execute "poetry run pre-commit install" to configure pre-commit hooks.
Then away we go!
